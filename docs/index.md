# kOps - Kubernetes Operations

[GoDoc]: https://pkg.go.dev/k8s.io/kops
[GoDoc Widget]: https://godoc.org/k8s.io/kops?status.svg

The easiest way to get a production grade Kubernetes cluster up and running.

## What is kOps?

We like to think of it as `kubectl` for clusters.

`kops` will not only help you create, destroy, upgrade and maintain production-grade, highly
available, Kubernetes cluster, but it will also provision the necessary cloud infrastructure.

[AWS](getting_started/aws.md) (Amazon Web Services) is currently officially supported, with [DigitalOcean](getting_started/digitalocean.md), [GCE](getting_started/gce.md) and [OpenStack](getting_started/openstack.md) in beta support, and [Azure](getting_started/azure.md) in alpha.

## Can I see it in action?
